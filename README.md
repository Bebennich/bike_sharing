# Bike Sahirng Analisis

## Live Dashboard
[Bike Sharing Dashboard](https://bikesharing-3tlvn2citvhvljt587rjvb.streamlit.app/)

## Project Overview
This project, submitted for the "Learn Data Analysis with Python" course from Dicoding, focuses on analyzing bike sahring data.
## Introduction
The goal of this project is to analyze bike sharing for What are annual bicycle usage trends, measured in days and hours? and What weather factor has the greatest influence on the number of bicycle rental companies?

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project includes bike sharing other related environmental data.

## Libraries Used
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- NumPy

## Key Insights
- Seasonal variation in PM2.5 levels with higher concentrations in colder months.
- Correlation between PM2.5 levels and weather conditions like temperature and humidity.
- Trends and patterns revealed through time series analysis.

## How to Run the Bike Sharing Analysis Dashboard
To run the Bike Sharing Analysis Dashboard, follow these steps:

## Create and Activate a Python Environment:
If using Conda (ensure Conda is installed):
 conda create --name bikesharing-ds python=3.9
 conda activate bike_sharing-ds

If using venv (standard Python environment tool):

 python -m venv bike_sharing-ds

## Install Required Packages:
The following packages are necessary for running the analysis and the dashboard:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn streamlit
Run the Streamlit App
Navigate to the project directory where dashboard/dashboard.py is located:

cd path/to/your/project/directory
streamlit run dashboard/dashboard.py

The dataset used for this analysis is included in the project repository. A detailed Python notebook (e.g., Proyek Analisi Data.ipynb) containing the data analysis and visualizations is also provided.
